                Why you do not set the state directly in React?

                    <p>While a React component can have initial state, the real power is in updating its state â€” after all, if we didn't need to update the state, the component shouldn't have any state. State is only reserved for data that changes in our component and is visible in the UI. Instead of directly modifying the state using this.</p>

                    <p>Unit testing is a software development process in which the smallest testable parts of an application, called units, are individually and independently scrutinized for proper operation.
                    One of the benefits of unit tests is that they isolate a function, class or method and only test that piece of code.
